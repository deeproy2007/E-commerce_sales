# E‑Commerce Data Analysis & Dashboard Project

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end‑to‑end **E‑commerce data analysis workflow** using **SQL, Python, and Power BI**. The objective is to analyze sales, customers, and order performance, and present actionable business insights through an interactive dashboard.

This project is designed for **portfolio, internship, and interview preparation**, showcasing real‑world data analytics skills.

## Business Problem

E‑commerce businesses often face challenges such as:

* Declining or fluctuating sales
* Identifying high‑value customers
* Understanding product and category performance
* Monitoring monthly and yearly revenue trends

This project answers key business questions such as:

* How are sales trending over time?
* Which products and categories generate the most revenue?
* Who are the top customers?
* What patterns exist in order behavior?

## Dataset Description

The dataset represents an **e‑commerce platform** and includes:

* Order details
* Customer information
* Product and category data
* Sales and revenue fields

The data is used across **SQL, Python, and Power BI** for analysis and visualization.

---

## Tools & Technologies Used

* **SQL** – Data querying, aggregation, window functions
* **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** – Data cleaning and exploratory analysis
* **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard and business insights
* **GitHub** – Version control and project documentation

## SQL Analysis (E-commerce.sql)

The SQL file contains queries focused on:

* Revenue and sales aggregation
* Customer‑level analysis
* Product and category performance
* Date‑based analysis (monthly/yearly trends)
* Use of **aggregate functions** (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`)
* Use of **window functions** (`RANK`, `ROW_NUMBER`, `OVER`)

### Example Business Use Cases Solved in SQL

* Top‑selling products by revenue
* Monthly sales growth analysis
* Ranking customers based on total spend
* Identifying repeat vs one‑time customers

---

## Python Analysis (main.ipynb)

The Jupyter Notebook focuses on:

* Loading and inspecting the dataset
* Handling missing or inconsistent values
* Converting and formatting date columns
* Grouping and aggregating data using Pandas
* Basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)

### Key Python Libraries Used

* `pandas`
* `matplotlib`
* `seaborn`

---

## Power BI Dashboard (ecommerce_dashboard.pbix)

The Power BI dashboard provides a **visual summary of business performance**.

### Key Dashboard Elements

* Total Revenue
* Total Orders
* Total Customers
* Monthly Sales Trend
* Top Products and Categories
* Customer Contribution Analysis

### Insights Generated

* Identification of peak sales periods
* High‑revenue product categories
* Customer segments contributing most to revenue

---

## Key Business Insights

* A small percentage of customers contribute a large share of total revenue
* Certain product categories consistently outperform others
* Sales show clear monthly and seasonal trends
* Repeat customers are more valuable than one‑time buyers

---

## Skills Demonstrated

* Business problem understanding
* SQL querying and optimization
* Analytical thinking
* Data cleaning and transformation
* Dashboard design and storytelling
* End‑to‑end project documentation

---

## How to Use This Project

1. Run the SQL queries using a supported database (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server)
2. Open `main.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to explore Python analysis
3. Open `ecommerce_dashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop to view the dashboard

---

## Future Improvements

* Add more advanced KPIs (Customer Lifetime Value, Retention Rate)
* Automate data refresh in Power BI
* Enhance dashboard with drill‑through pages
* Add predictive sales analysis using machine learning
